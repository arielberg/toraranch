                    The Halutz program has chosen to rise from today’s
                    crises and embark upon a new endeavor to cultivate the Jewish leaders of tomorrow;
                    those who will strengthen our Nation and our presence in the Land, and become
                    the "pioneers" of tomorrow in all aspects of life.

                    תכנית חלוץ בחרה להתרומם מהיום
                    משברים ויציאה למאמץ חדש לטפח את המנהיגים היהודים של המחר;
                    אלה שיחזקו את אומתנו ואת נוכחותנו בארץ ויהפכו
                    ה"חלוצים" של המחר בכל היבטי החיים.
                </span>
            </p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>The Halutz program prepares its participants for the challenges of adult
                Jewish life today, creating a new cadre of ‘pioneers’ that will see themselves leading
                our People in a variety of fields, based on in-depth Torah understandings and a living
                connection to the Land of Israel developed by actually working the land.
                The program encourages not only that we study Torah, but that we apply Torah both
                on the personal level and on the national level. By combining a living Torah together
                with other fields of knowledge and professional training in a variety of trades and
                practical work in agriculture and land development, the program aims to create a
                unique individual who will be equipped to face the challenges of the next generation.</p>

            <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
            <p>
                Halutz participants will be afforded the opportunity to participate as pioneers
                building our homeland, while engaging intimately with those Israelis most
                passionately committed to the story of the Jewish people.
                The daily schedule includes regular study hours in the Beit Midrash, the goal of
                which is to enable every young man to take an active part in understanding and
                clarifying for himself our Torah and the Jewish faith, while applying insights together
                with their mentors to meet the challenges of the day.
                By living, working, and studying alongside craftsmen, vintners, shepherds and
                farmers, students will learn new skills and develop their connection to today’s Jewish
                renaissance, actually creating, building, and working the Land while deepening their
                commitment to our people’s rich heritage.
                The program operates on an apprenticeship basis, offering seminars in fields that
                include woodworking, stone-masonry, welding, organic farming, tanning,
                shepherding, wine-making and more, linking these crafts to the powerful spiritual
                teachings and traditional values of the People of Israel. Participants will experience
                the entire process of manufacture and production from raw materials to the creation
                of magnificent artworks, gaining practical tools to be leaders of the next generation.
                In-the-field learning will be augmented with lectures and workshops ranging from
                Torah lessons to topics like Middle East history and geopolitics.
                In addition, there will be a common fund with which the students of the Kedem
                Academy will finance enrichment activities to prepare them for leading roles in the
                Israeli military, including:
                Guided tours.
                Field workshops.
                Workshops to get to know Israeli society.
                Navigation and topography studies.
                MDS and physical and mental preparation for military service.
                External lessons of role models (Rabbis, heroes of Israel, pioneers, etc.)
                Diverse social activity

            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>
                The Halutz program is a new educational project
                situated on the Pnei Kedem Farm, in southeast Gush Etzion on the edge of the
                Judean desert, overlooking the Dead Sea, above the Arugot stream that runs all the
                way down to the famous springs of Ein Gedi. The farm itself controls thousands of
                acres of State Land, raises sheep and goats, has a variety of wine vineyards and
                other agricultural endeavors. The farm is committed to redeeming and developing
                the Land, beautifying it with hiking trails, observation points, resting places and other
                tourist attractions.
                Halutz participants live, study, and work on the farm, develop the Land, and receive
                practical tools to deal with the various challenges that life on a pioneering farm
                invites.
                The relative remoteness of the farm and the spaces around it constitute an ideal
                platform for an educational process that will grow the leaders of tomorrow.
